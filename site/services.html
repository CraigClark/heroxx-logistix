            <h2 id="customs">Customs</h2>

            <aside>
                <p>One of the costliest area of logistics is the lack of compliance.</p>
            </aside>

            <p>Customs requirements are complicated. Every border that your goods cross will have its own set of rules and regulations concerning everything from acceptable marking/packaging, to safety of materials and articles, as well as intellectual rights and environmental concerns. At Heroxx Logistix, we are always up to speed on the latest requirements that need to be met to move goods across borders without delay.</p>

            <p>The universal "Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System", also known as the Harmonized System – or "HS code" for short, is the foundation for the calculation of duties to pay, the requirements of other government departments, of rules of origin – for over 180 countries and territories around the world, and over 400 free trade agreements.</p>

            <p>Our extensive knowledge of the HS allows us to confidently assign the correct and accurate classification to your product, and if necessary, challenge the classification assigned by others. We verify the justifications for the country of origin, and we document the approval process of the numerous agencies in the country of destination. We also provide full understanding of the Rules of Origin to enable you to benefit from Free Trade Agreements.</p>

            <p>You have your own compliance team – no problem, our training workshops help keep them up to date.</p>

            <p>We keep our clients informed of any social or political issues that may affect the movement of goods across borders such as embargoes, trade sanctions and political unrest.</p>

            <h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

            <aside>
                <p>The most common cause for shipment delays is incomplete documentation.</p>
            </aside>

            <p>At Heroxx Logistix we understand the technologies commonly used in the business of order fulfilment. Most Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems, and many carrier-provided software solutions do not produce documents required for international shipping, or cannot adapt to your specific requirements. Certificates of origin, phytosanitary certificates, dangerous goods classification, toxic substances declarations, manufacturer’s affidavits and many others may be required for your shipment to arrive on time.</p>

            <h3>Certificates or origin</h3>

            <p>Free Trade Agreements present opportunities as well as challenges. NAFTA in itself requires a documented chain of certifications before an international sale can benefit from it.</p>

            <p>CETA is a new Free Trade Agreement linking Canada to the European Union, a market with a population of 500 million. Contact us to learn more about the opportunities it represents for your company.</p>

            <p>We have been seamlessly assisting wholesalers and manufacturers stay on top of their certification programs since 1997. From the chasing of certificates from suppliers, to analyzing the bills of materials, obtaining rulings on customs classification to producing and delivering certificates to your customers and customs brokers.</p>

            <h3>Shipping documentation</h3>

            <p>We will give your shipment the attention it deserves, and insure that the document package is done accurately and completely. We will help you with the certificate of origin, other government agencies’ requirements, and any one of dozens of additional forms that are often the culprits when your shipment misses a deadline.</p>

            <h3>Responding to requests and audits from customs officials</h3>

            <p>Most requests for information from customs authorities are innocent enough, and result from a missing detail or the inexperience of the customs officer involved. However, if the goal is to detect a more serious breach of the import regulations, it is in your best interest to know what officials are truly looking for before you respond.</p>

            <p>We review the shipment history and customs request and provide you with a clear picture of the reasons behind the request.</p>

            <p>We ensure that the response is complete and accurate, and presented in a way that no further review or investigation follows. You will also know, before the response is sent, what the potential consequences are, and what steps you can take immediately to minimize the impact of enforcement action if the import declaration was less than perfect, pointing to a serious anomaly in your compliance program.</p>

            <h2 id="freight">Freight</h2>

            <p>How can you get a large pallet from Wausau to San Diego, overnight? How about oversized production machinery from Baltimore to Oshawa? Your transportation needs are unique, and all carriers are not made equal.</p>

            <p>Carriers are typically specialized. They may focus on a certain region or type of freight. Over the years, we have seen firsthand how well they handled a wide variety of shipments under diverse conditions. We maintain careful records of carriers and will help you choose a carrier that best suits your needs.</p>

            <h2 id="process">Processes</h2>

            <p>In a perfect world, your ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) system would manage all of the data that is required for very part of the supply chain.</p>

            <p>The reality may well be that the source data is contained, managed or manipulated in another database, by other software. This in turn requires clearly designed processes to link all of these in a manner that the data can be used efficiently</p>

            <p>Special attention must also be given to situations that cannot be addressed with off-the-shelf solutions, such as:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Managing multiple origins for the same part number</li>

                <li>Trade compliance data into various countries</li>

                <li>Repairs, returns and exchange programs</li>
            </ul>

            <p>We will map the logistics requirements and processes in a way that your IT team can understand them, ensuring a smooth implementation.</p>

            <h2 id="costaudit">Auditing</h2>

            <aside>
                <p>Recover overpayments of freight, brokerage, duty and taxes at the right time – and reduce your costs today.</p>
            </aside>

            <p>We can perform an audit of your logistics providers’ invoices that will give us a good snapshot of your typical costs and requirements.</p>

            <p>We usually identify key savings and recoveries within a few weeks. Whether the process involves appealing customs classification or value, submitting NMFC (National Motor Freight Classification) justifications, starting one of the various drawback programs or putting together a major Request For Proposal, we will make a positive difference to your bottom line.</p>

            <p>Our audit report will also outline opportunities that we have uncovered, either for future savings or for streamlining your processes, as well as alerting you to potential compliance shortfalls.</p>
